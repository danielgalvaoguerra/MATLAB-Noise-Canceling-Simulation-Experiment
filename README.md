# MATLAB-Noise-Canceling-Simulation-Experiment

Writen after an introductory course on multimedia and signal processing.

Simulates the imperfect nature of noise-cancelling signal processing with the generation of a randomly generated noise tone and an imperfect "anti-noise" tone.

Utilizes a GUI to show different signals such as the noise by itself, the song by itself, the song+noise, and the noise cancelled song.
